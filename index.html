		<p> My name is Colin Roberts. I was born in Atlanta, Georgia and I'm 23 years old. I'm currently a senior at the University of Tennessee at Martin.</p>
		
		<p> I am 6 feet 1 inch tall and weigh 195 pounds. I am majoring in Interdisciplinary Studies with a focus in business and biology. I am a big sports guy. I love watching and playing sports. My favorite sport is baseball. I played baseball in college at Jackson State Community College and at Bethel University. In high school, I played four years of baseball, football, and basketball. My favorite baseball team is the Atlanta Braves. My favorite food is chicken. My favorite hobbies are hanging out friends and family, watching sports, and being active. I love to travel and explore different places. Some of my favorite places that I have visited are Los Angeles, California, Big Sky Montana, Vail, Colorado, and Las Vegas, Nevada. I am a big family guy. I am very close to my mother, father, and sister. I only have one sibling. I was raised and still live in Bruceton, Tennessee. I am a little shy in new situations, but once I get comfortable I am very outgoing. I like to lead by example and am very motivated. I am a very competitive person and have always wanted to be the best at everything I do. Second place has never satisfied me, but I also enjoy seeing others succeed. I want to succeed in life to be able to take care of my parents like they have taken care of me my entire life. I want to be able to provide for my children like my parents did for me. I am a very religious person. I am a Christian and put God first in everything I do. I enjoy helping others. The most fulfilling feeling I get is helping someone in need and putting a smile on someone else's face. My mother is an x-ray tech and my father is a chiropractor, so I have always grown up around the medical field. I have always enjoyed the medical field and building relationships with people which is why after college I plan to get a job as a Medical Sales Representative or go to PA school. I want to start a practice somewhere here in West Tennessee with my cousin who is a Nurse Practitioner. I want to be able to work with athletes and help them recover from injuries. I also have a passion for coaching sports and teaching others skills and fundamentals of the game. Hopefully I will be able to coach my kid's sports teams and help them and their teammates grow as athletes and as individuals. When I die I want to be remembered as a hard-working individual that was always kind and willing to help others.
